    "I used a pair plot as a inital point of contact during the EDA process. The resulting pair plot can be viewed in files: images > EDA_pairplot.png. There are obvious strong correlations between 'free_bikes', 'empty_slots' and '% used' since they are all related to one another. This however, is not unhelpful information as it confirms that the data extraction process was successful in this limited capacity. The more interesting of the preliminary observations can be seen with the relationship between 'venues_nearby' with all other metrics. \n",

    "This will be at the core of the regression modelling that will be addressed later and may prove some interesting patterns. At a glance there seems to be a slight positive trend between 'free_bikes' + 'venue_nearby' and a slight negative trend between 'empty_slots' + 'venues_nearby'.\n",

    "This qualitatively makes sense as the dataset was pulled around 11pm Barcelona local time. This relationship may show that during the evening, less bikes are used around these venues. These venues tend to be large with much commercial zoning surrounding them - leading to a general decreased use of the bikes during that hour in those zones."
